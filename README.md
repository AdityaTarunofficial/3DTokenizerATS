3D Tokenizer Project
This project uses Node.js, Express, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to tokenize sentences and visualize them in a 3D scatter plot using Plotly.js. Enter a sentence, and the app will break it down into tokens, display their lengths, and create a dynamic 3D plot to illustrate the token distribution.  

Features:
- Tokenization of input sentences using `natural.WordTokenizer`.
- Visualization of token indices, lengths, and random depth in a 3D scatter plot.
- Built with Express.js and Plotly.js for seamless web integration.

Technologies: Node.js, Express, Natural, Plotly.js, HTML, Bootstrap
