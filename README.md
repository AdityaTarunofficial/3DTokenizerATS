# 🧑‍💻 3D Tokenizer

Welcome to the **3D Tokenizer** project! This web application allows users to input sentences and visualize the tokenization process in a 3D scatter plot. Built with Node.js and Express for the backend and plain HTML/CSS for the frontend, this project serves as an educational tool for understanding natural language processing (NLP).

## 🌟 Features

- **Tokenization**: Enter a sentence to see how it is split into individual tokens (words).
- **3D Visualization**: View tokens in a 3D scatter plot that displays their length and a randomly generated value.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy interaction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **NLP Library**: Natural
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **3D Visualization**: Plotly.js
